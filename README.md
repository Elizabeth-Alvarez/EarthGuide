A mock website template of a NASA project

This project is a mock version of the real website that was developed for one of NASA's projects. Since information and 
images are sensitive and this project is yet to be conducted, the website has not and will not go live until the expedition
is underway. This project is simple and incorporates the many traits any other well functioning website has. Ranging from 
tabs, scrolling, to media that plays in multiple operating systems and devices.

- Took the template given to me from the web designer and converted it into HTML and used CSS to stylize the pages allowing
  the efficiency of changes. 
- Performed trial and error methods to ensure code was multi-browser compatible in the following four major browsers: 
  Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer.
- Appended javascript files to control tabs, scrolling buttons, and footer to concise code.
- Took a step back to analyze current technology trends and incorporate the products and software students are using as 
  forms of learning and studying tools. Then altered the code to ensure content on the website is visible in such devices 
  as Ipads.
